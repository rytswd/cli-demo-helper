# CLI Demo Helper

## ðŸš€ Examples

![Demo with minimal setup](./assets/demo-minimal.gif)

> Ref: [example-minimal.sh](/example-minimal.sh) file used in above example

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash

# shellcheck source=./demo-helper.sh
source "$(dirname "$0")/demo-helper.sh"

comment "Starting demo with demo-helper..."
execute "ls -la"

comment_r "Special characters are written as is, such as '\\~!!@(*#@)"
comment_g "It is simple to use, you just need to source the helper script."
comment_b "No extra tool needed."

comment "End of demo!"
```

## âœ¨ Usage

You would simply need to `source` the `demo-helper.sh` file, and use provided functions.

The simplest approach is to copy the file to your local, by running something like below.

```bash
{
    # Copy shell script to your local environment
    curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rytswd/cli-demo-helper/main/demo-helper.sh > demo-helper.sh

    # Provided that you are copying the demo-helper.sh in the same directory
    # as your shell script, you can simply add this towards the top of your
    # script.
    echo '
Copy below in your script

# shellcheck source=./demo-helper.sh
source "$(dirname "$0")/demo-helper.sh"'
}
```
